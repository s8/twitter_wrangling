    "The main challenge I experienced when wrangling this dataset was a relatively open brief. Having no specific focus made it particularly challenging to make decisions which data to keep / discard and which format is best suited for particular types of data. Resisting the urge to keep cleaning and rearranging data was an exercise in self-control.\n",

    "One of the first challenges I faced was when downloading twitter archive and saving it into a properly structured json file. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another peculiar challenge arose when looking into int and str representations of tweet id’s. When reading the json with read_json function there was considerable amount of mismatches between the str and int columns. Eventually it appeared that the function’s type inference option was behaving in a very strange manner, corrupting some of the strings when converting them into ints. With the dtype=False flag turned off things came back to normal.\n",

    "Significant amount of data in the merged dataset was duplicated, particularly using ‘int’ and ‘str’ types for data integrity purposes. Once basic checks were done that data is intact - all the duplicate data was removed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some other columns were nearly empty and as such were difficult to make use of in our analysis. Therefore data from them was saved to separate variables and columns deleted from the dataset."
